# LaMouse
This repository serves to add USB mouse capabilities to FortunaOS, used on the 'La Fortuna' board (built on the Atmel AT90USB1286).

The code is derived from the LUFA library written by Dean Camera, which can be found at http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php, and adapted to work with the rotary encoder on the La Fortuna board.

# Features
- Mouse navigation using the North, South, East and West switches
- Left-clicking using the Center switch

# Future Extensions
- Right-clicking
- Scrolling
